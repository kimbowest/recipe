# Mediterranean Stew Recipe

This is a LOCAL change :)

### Recipe

*line 2 changed remotely* This recipe captures the essence of a rustic Mediterranean stew, brimming with sun-ripened tomatoes, aromatic herbs, and **tender chunks of eggplant**. Perfect for a cozy dinner, its layers of flavor are best enjoyed with crusty bread to soak up the rich, hearty sauce.

1. Start by dicing the eggplant.
2. Saut√© the eggplant with olive oil until tender.
3. Add chopped tomatoes and herbs.
4. Simmer until all ingredients are well cooked.
5. Serve with crusty bread.
